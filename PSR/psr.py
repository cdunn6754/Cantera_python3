## Description
# A PSR combustor. Two separate streams - one coal volatiles and the other air, both at
# 300 K and 1 atm flow into an adiabatic and constant pressure
# combustor where they mix and burn.

# Writen so that we can write out a csv file for a particular combination of 
# chemical mechanism and fuel composition. It writes these to the csv directory.
# The ppPsr.py script then reads these csv's and plots/ post processes them.

# From the original Cantera file starter thing that I kept:
# We are interested in the steady-state burning solution. Since at 300 K no
# reaction will occur between fuel and air, we need to use an 'igniter' to
# initiate the chemistry. A simple igniter is a pulsed flow of atomic hydrogen.
# After the igniter is turned off, the system approaches the steady burning
# solution.
